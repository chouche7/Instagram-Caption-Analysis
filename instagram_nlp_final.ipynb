    "Technology has democratized advertising in our society, with influencer marketing emerging as a mainstream form of online marketing. Brands collaborate with popular online influencers to market products or services in order to improve brand recognition among target audiences. Unlike celebrities, influencers in social media can be anyone who has built a reputation for their knowledge and expertise on a specific topic. They are influential due to their large followings on the web which brands take advantage of because they can create trends and encourage their followers to buy products they promote. Influencers have the potential to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with their audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the results that can be gained through influencer marketing, researching and finding the right influencers is not an easy process. To achieve results and effectively engage the right audience, brands need to identify individuals who can act as genuine brand ambassadors and bring consumers on board with the products and services. Selecting an influencer that fits the brand can help to achieve the engagement and traffic desired. Simply looking at online profiles with the most followers might not satisfy a particular niche for the brands which is why they often spend considerable time finding the right influencers to achieve a good engagement rate with a targeted audience. Determining how different influencers generate traction and engagement rate is important, so that brands can allocate their budget more effectively when looking to sponsor. Thus, the main objective for this project is to examine how information on Instagram posts (captions, comments, sponsorship) and the influencer (category, bio, followers, followees) can be used to determine how popular a post will be. In particular, I also believe that the content of captions accompanying Instagram posts provide important context and are thus important in eliciting likes and shares.\n"

The posts are specifically split into two types of categories: sponsored brand mentions and non-sponsored brand mentions. A sponsored post is one where the influencer gets paid for advertising and mentioning the name of the brand. "

    "The original raw data files given to us by Professor Kim comprise multiple JSON and text files. Due to the size of the data, we had to manually extract the information from each file in order to clean, process and merge it all into one big dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are approximately 12 GB (3 GB when in zipped format) worth of JSON files containing specific profile and post information. The 1,601,074 JSON files are structured such that each file contains information on 1 profile. Since the number of fields available in each JSON file is not consistent, we extracted relevant fields from the approximately 1.6 million files and compiled them into a single dataset. During this process of compiling the JSON files, we also unpacked the objects within the JSON files and cleaned the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the captions and comments were packed into dictionaries and required unpacking. Notably, the text in the captions or comments were not analyzed in the original paper by the author (Kim et al., 2021). However, the nature of the content can possibly add a useful dimension to the dataset. Thus, we decided to take up the challenge of doing NLP processing of this huge Instagram dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we were interested in predicting popular influencers and not the content of comments elicited and also because of the constraint of resources and time, we decided to use only the captions as a feature to predict popularity. Caption content is relevant because it adds to the information of a post’s picture and can elicit strong responses, sharing by viewers and lend context to the post. In addition, only a subset of the JSON posts had comments, thus we decided to focus on the captions.\n"

    "Bag-of-words model was used as a tool of feature generation for the captions. After transforming the text of captions into a bag-of-words, we performed the calculation of term frequency, which refers to the number of times a term appears in the text. Term frequency (TF) might not be the best representation of the text because the common words like ‘the’,’a’,’is’ are most likely to be the highest frequency terms. Thus, to address this problem, the term frequency was converted into term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). The reason we need IDF is to minimize the weighting of common terms while making infrequent terms have a higher impact. Putting both together, the TF-IDF score tells how important and relevant a term is. \n",

    "Then, we performed sentiment analysis on the text of comments to tag the comments as “positive”, “neutral” and “negative”. This will add a useful feature of popularity in addition to the number of likes and comments a post garners. While we initially planned to create our own sentiment analysis model using the TF-IDF results and compare with some pre-trained models, the sheer volume of the data meant that we were unable to complete some steps because of the limitations of our systems’ computing power. \n"

    "One thing to note is that boosting algorithms are extremely sensitive to outliers. This is because every classifier works off of the errors of its predecessors, so every model is forced to learn even the “bad” data. To prevent this from occurring, we made our best attempt in removing outliers by applying Cook’s Distance first to a multiple linear regression model. Cook’s Distance is measured by the difference in fitted values when the specific datum point is removed from the model; hence, data that shift our output values greatly will have a large distance (to be removed). Usually, this method only applies to the least-squares method, but due to time constraints, we used it to look for highly influential points for both the LASSO and AdaBoost models."

    "Feature importance is calculated in regression trees based on the total reduction of a criterion (squared error) brought by that feature. It does not imply that a particular feature is positively or negatively correlated with the dependent variable, but only the significance it has on producing meaningful results. It is also hard to infer anything statistically significant from the LASSO coefficients because of the high MAPE, but we can still learn about certain words by comparing the two models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the LASSO coefficients and AdaBoost feature importance, a couple words standout in particular such as \"code\", \"link\", \"gifted\", and \"ad\". These are all common terms that influencers use when they want to capture the attention of the audience by either selling them discounted products with their affiliate code or giveaway free items if the user satisfies certain conditions that are set by the influencer (usually includes liking and sharing the post which helps the influencer gain more traction). These tend to work well with the instagram audience which is why sponsors are always looking for new influencers to help them promote their products via this method. Even the word \"profile\" is often commonly used in captions to have the audience click on a specific link to purchase something, or look at a specific information in the bio such as their unique discount code. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we can compare the words between LASSO and AdaBoost, we see that the two overlapping words are \"code\", \"use\" and \"outfit\" which clearly shows the importance of discounts when promoting items for brands. These affiliate codes and links seem to draw people into whatever content the influencer is posting especially topics related to fashion, makeup, or dressing up. "

    "In summary, we have used NLP analysis of a huge dataset of captions as a feature in predicting popularity of influencers. Certain words increase the popularity of the post and provide more traction to the influencer while other contents could prove to be detrimental. \n",
    "\n",
    "For future work and given more resources for processing huge datasets, it will be insightful to also analyze the contents of comments elicited as a possible predictor (or indicator) of popularity. The TF-IDF scores on the captions have shown to be somewhat lackluster in terms of prediction strength due to the small number of text in each document. It seems that even though certain words are more powerful than others, it doesn't translate directly into more or less likes. However, it has helped explain some of the most prominent words used on Instagram. More NLP models should be considered in the future especially those that can provide semantic understanding of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the scarcity of Instagram-trained models for captions or comments, I also believe that it will be helpful to contribute to the field by creating our own instagram-trained model and compare to other existing Twitter or general purpose models, so that more businesses and social media users can benefit from our research.\n"
